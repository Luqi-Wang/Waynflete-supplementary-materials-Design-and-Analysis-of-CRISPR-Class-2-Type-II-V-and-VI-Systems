# selecting-crRNA-spacer-sequences-based-on-target-gene-
# This program is coded in Python 3 language.
# It opens a SARS-CoV-2 RdRp genome text file which has the entrie mRNA nucleotide sequence for the RdRp, and then selects the 22 nucleotide crRNA spacer sequences 
# that target the RdRp using Cas13. It also writes the selected crRNA array into a file and formats it into the FASTA format for the BLAST multi query search. For full details of the crRNA selection instructions please email 12LWang@mcsoxford.org to request the academic paper.
# This program serves as a supplementary material for the academic paper: Design and Analysis of CRISPR Class 2, Type II, V, and VI Systems as Effective Treatments for Viral Infections
