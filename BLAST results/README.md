# This program is coded in Python 3 language.
# It opens a SARS-CoV-2 RdRp genome text file which has the entrie mRNA nucleotide sequence for the RdRp, and then selects the 22 nucleotide crRNA spacer sequences 
# that target the RdRp using Cas13. For full details of the crRNA selection instructions please email 12LWang@mcsoxford.org to request the academic paper.
# This program serves as a supplementary material for the academic paper: Design and Analysis of CRISPR Class 2, Type II, V, and VI Systems as Effective Treatments for Viral Infections
